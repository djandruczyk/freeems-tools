Textual freeems-streaming reader:

Purpose: To connect to live ECU or simulator and display the variables in the
stream, via either a textual or graphical interface, with logging to logfiles
of various formats, i.e. MS style (tab sep values), XML, JSON, etc)

Suggested UI's include ncurses, GTK+ and Qt.

Pseudocode

main
  init threads
  init startup datastructures/settings
  init serial
  ecu  detection?  is it needed?
  start reader/parser engine thread
  detect txt/graphical environment
  load appropriate gui plugin
  start gui display


Serial Init
  check for port presence
  open port
  setup port params
  create g_io_channel and watch

Serial I/O
  g_io_channel watch will poll port for us and kickoff handler anytime data 
  arrives to be parsed.  Not sure if we want to pump ythe data over to a thread
  or not so it doesn't get in the way of any gui shit.

Gui
  need some sort of stdized plugin API so that the gui side can be 
  decoupled from the I/O side.
